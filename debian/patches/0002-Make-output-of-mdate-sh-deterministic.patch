Subject: Make output of mdate-sh deterministic

mdate-sh pretty-prints the modification time of a file.
But it's output can vary depending on the timezone of
the caller. Someone in timezone GMT-12 will get a different
result (day) than someone in timezone GMT+12.

As this output is also used to create/update stamp files,
which influence the further build process, the build result
can vary.
To enable reproducible builds and to have a more deterministic
build behavior, this change fixes the timezone to UTC.
